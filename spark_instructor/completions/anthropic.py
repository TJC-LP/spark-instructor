"""
This module defines Pydantic models for Anthropic's chat completion API responses.

It extends the base models from spark_instructor.completions.base to provide
specific implementations for Anthropic's API structure. These models can be used
to parse and validate Anthropic API responses, ensuring type safety and
providing easy access to response data.

Anthropic's completion models are not serializable out of the box, primarily due to Tools schema.
We may add support for Anthropic Tools later on.
